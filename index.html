        <p>Hello Everyone! I'm currently a senior at the University of South Florida with a major in Business Analytics and information systems.
             I hope to secure an internship by the end of this year to ensure my chances in my job opportunities after graduation.
            When it comes to searching for a career, I want a place that I can truly benefit from and also help those around me.
        </p>
